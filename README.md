# Real-Time Predictive Maintenance for Industrial IoT Using Edge Intelligence
Machinery downtime in industrial settings can lead to significant productivity losses and revenue reduction. Un-planned maintenance and sudden equipment failures pose major operational challenges. This project focuses on developing predictive maintenance system using edge computing to monitor machine health, forecast maintenance needs, and mitigate unexpected failures.

The system is deployed on edge computing boards, integrated with temperature and acoustic sensors for comprehensive machinery condition monitoring. By leveraging edge computing and advanced machine learning algorithms, this system aims to minimize unplanned downtime, enhancing operational efficiency in industrial environments.
